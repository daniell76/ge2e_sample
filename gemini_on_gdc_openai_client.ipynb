      "This is a speech given by Martin Luther King Jr.  The speaker begins by stating that the current event will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the nation's history. He then references the Emancipation Proclamation, signed 100 years prior, which brought hope to millions of slaves, but notes that 100 years later, the Negro is still not free, and remains burdened by segregation and discrimination.  He speaks of a dream where one day the sons of former slaves and slave owners will sit together, and where the state of Mississippi will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. He dreams of a day when his children will be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. The speech then continues with a powerful call for freedom and equality across the United States, invoking imagery of freedom ringing from mountains and hills across different states. The speech culminates in a vision of a day when black and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics will join hands and sing the words of the old Negro spiritual, \"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\"\n",
